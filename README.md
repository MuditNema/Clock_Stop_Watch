# Clock_Stop_Watch
This is my second project . It is a single page website made using vanilla javascript ,html and css . It is fully responsive , so one can access it in any device . It basically has a digital and an analog clock and along with this a stopwatch with basic features like start/stop/reset. Any suggestions are much appreciated.
